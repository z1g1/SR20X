	<h1>SR 2012 Scenario Refernce Sheet</h1>
		<h2>Scenario Glossary</h2>
			<h3>Starting number</h3>
				<p>
					The number of models that a model/unit starts with based on the PC paid. Models that are discounted always use their card’s listed PC and model count for scoring. Models that are free also use the card’s PC and model count for scoring. If a free model/unit does not begin the game in play then the lowest PC on the card is used to determine the model count required for scoring.
				</p>
			<h3>Own</h3>
				<p>
					Models listed, or created by effects, within a player’s fielded army list.
				</p>
			<h3>Control</h3>
				<p>
					See Zone, Flag and Objective.
				</p>
			<h3>Contest</h3>
				<p>
					A player must own at least one model within a zone, within 4” of a flag, or within 4” of an objective to contest. Inert warjacks, wild warbeasts, fleeing models, out of formation models, and models that you own that are under the control of your opponent cannot contest.
				</p>
			<h3>Zone</h3>
				<p>
					A player controls a zone if he owns one or more models within a zone that an opponent does not contest. Ignore inert warjacks, wild warbeasts, fleeing models, out of formation models and models that you own that are under the control of your opponent when checking for control. There are no additional requirements for warcasters, warlocks, warjacks, or warbeasts.
				</p>
				<p>
					For a unit to control a zone the unit must contain 50% or more of its starting number (rounding up) and all remaining models must be within the same zone.
				</p>
				<p>
					For a solo to control a zone, it must have an army point cost of 1 or more. For solos that consist of multiple models, divide the PC of the solo by the model count on the card to see if each model is worth at least 1 point. For multiple model solos to control a zone they must contain 50% or more of their starting number (rounding up) and all remaining models must be within the same zone.
				</p>
			<h3>Reinforcements</h3>
				<p>
					During the maintenance phase, on a player’s 2nd turn or later, these models can be placed within 3” of the reinforcements line shown in the scenario diagram. All of a player’s reinforcements must be placed on the same turn.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the turn that reinforcement warjacks enter the game, during the focus allocation step of your Control Phase, they are allocated 3 free focus. This focus is only applied to warjacks controlled by a warcaster that started the game in play and cannot exceed the normal focus allocation limit.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the turn that reinforcement warbeasts enter the game they can be forced while outside of their controlling warlock’s control area. This rule only applies to warbeasts controlled by a warlock that started the game in play.
				</p>
			<h3>Flag (40 mm base)</h3>
				<p>
					All flags are models with the following qualities:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Incorporeal, stationary models</li>
						<li>Immune to all in-game effects; do not activate</li>
						<li>Cannot be targeted, damaged, moved, placed, or removed from play</li>
					</ul>
				<p>
					A player controls a flag if he owns one or more models B2B with a flag that an opponent does not contest. Ignore inert warjacks, wild warbeasts, fleeing models, out of formation models and models that you own that are under the control of your opponent when checking for control conditions. There are no additional requirements for warcasters, warlocks, warjacks, or warbeasts.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the B2B model is a member of a unit, the unit must contain 50% or more of its starting number (rounding up) and all remaining models must also be within 4? of the flag.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the B2B model is a solo it must have an army point cost of 1 or more. For solos that consist of multiple models, divide the PC of the solo by the model count on the card to see if each model is worth at least 1 point. For multiple model solos to control a flag the solo must contain 50% or more of its starting number (rounding up) and all remaining models must also be within 4? of the flag.
				</p>
			<h3>Objective (50 mm base)</h3>
				<p>
					A player controls an objective if his warcaster/warlock is within 4” of an objective that an opponent does not contest.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some scenarios will add additional qualities to objectives or contradict the properties below - in those cases the scenario takes precedence. All objectives are structures (Warmachine Prime, p.88) with the following additional qualities:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>ARM 20, Damage: 20</li>
						<li>Block LOS as a 50mm base</li>
						<li>Can be charged</li>
						<li>Can be damaged by ranged weapons of any POW</li>
						<li>Cannot be targeted/damaged on turn 1</li>
						<li>Cannot be advanced, slammed, thrown, pushed or placed</li>
					</ul>
			<h3>Kill Box</h3>
				<p>
					If a player ends his turn with a friendly warcaster/warlock within 10” of any board edge, starting on the first player’s 2nd turn, then that warcaster/warlock is destroyed.
				</p>
		<h2>Victory and Tiebreakers</h2>
			<h3>Assassination Victory</h3>
				When only one player owns Warcasters/Warlocks remaining in play, that player immediately wins the game. Conduct CP scoring upon an assassination victory – this round of scoring does not change game results. If all WC/WL’s are simultaneously destroyed the game ends and victory is determined by tiebreaker conditions.
			<h3>Scenario Victory</h3>
				When a player has fulfilled the victory conditions described in the scenario, that player immediately wins the game.
			<h3>1st Tiebreaker</h3>
				If time runs out before a player has won the game, the player who owns the most warcasters/warlocks remaining in play wins the game. If both players own the same number of warcasters/warlocks in play, check the 2nd tiebreaker to determine the winner.
			<h3>2nd Tiebreaker</h3>
				The player who has the most control points wins the game. If both players have the same number of control points, check the 3rd tiebreaker to determine the winner.
			<h3>3rd Tiebreaker</h3>
				Tally the army point value of the models/units owned by each player within the area designated by the scenario. Ignore inert warjacks, wild warbeasts, and fleeing models when checking 3rd tiebreaker conditions. The player with more army points in the designated area wins the game. If both players have the same number of army points in the designated area, check the 4th tiebreaker to determine the winner.
					<ul>
						<li>Warcasters/Warlocks: 5 points for each warcaster or warlock (regardless of warjack and warbeast bonus points) within the scoring area. If a warcaster or warlock choice consists of multiple models, all the models with the warcaster or warlock subtype must be within the scoring area. Models automatically included with the warcaster or warlock choice without the warcaster or warlock subtype do not affect warcaster/warlock scoring.</li>
						<li>Warjacks/Warbeasts: Points equal to the army point cost of the model within the scoring area.</li>
						<li>Units and Unit Attachments: Points equal to the unit’s army point cost. Ignore units that have fewer than 50% (rounding up) of their starting number remaining in play when counting army points. At least half (rounding up) of the remaining models must be within the scoring area. Models with the Attachment ability add to the unit’s value and also add to the number of models needed. For example, ten Long Gunners need five or more models in play to be worth 10 points, and twelve Long Gunners including their unit attachment need six or more models to be worth 12 points.</li>
						<li>Solos: Points equal to the army point cost of the model within the scoring area. If a solo choice consists of multiple models, ignore solo choices that have fewer than 50% (rounding up) of their starting number remaining in play when counting army points. All remaining models must be within the scoring area for the solo choice’s value to be counted.</li>
					</ul>
			<h3>4th Tiebreaker</h3>
				Tally each player’s army points destroyed or removed from play as described below. The player whose opponent suffered more army points destroyed/removed from play wins the game.
					<ul>
						<li>Models/units are worth their army points value.</li>
						<li>Units below 50% of their starting number (rounding up) are worth 50% of their army points (rounding up) including all attachments.</li>
						<li>Count the full army points value for inert warjacks and wild warbeasts.</li>
						<li>Warcasters and warlocks are worth 5 army points.</li>
					</ul>
		<h2>Scenario Scoring - Exceptions</h2>
			<p>
				All the standard rules for scenarios are contained within the SR2012 scenario reference sheet above. However, there are certain models that do not conform well to these general guidelines. They are listed here with answers to the commonly asked questions as they pertain to scenarios.

			<strong>Kallus’ Feat (Incubi): At the end of your opponent’s turn group all remaining created Incubi into groups of 5 and the remainder into another group of X, which counts as X remaining from a group of 5. Each of these groups now counts as a purchased Incubi solo and follows the standard scenario rules for multiple model solos.</strong>
