	<h1>Steamroller 2012</h1>
	<p>
		In Steamroller tournaments, players face off in a series of games and pit their skills against increasingly challenging opponents to determine who will emerge victorious. Steamroller is ideal for groups of 8 to 64 players and promotes fast and furious play while stressing the ability to adapt to a variety of scenarios.
	<p>
	<h2>Player Responsibilities</h2>
		<h3>Logistics</h3>
			<p>
				Players participating in a Steamroller 2012 (SR2012) event must bring all their own models, stat cards, dice, measuring devices, markers, and templates they require for play. Tokens representing in game effects such as focus, fury, spells and abilities are required and must be kept adjacent to the corresponding model on the table. Players should also bring a copy of the SR2012 scenario reference sheet for use during the tournament.ÀÀ
			</p>
		<h3>Army Lists</h3>
			<p>
				Players must bring two legible copies of all their army lists complete with point costs. Army list point totals cannot exceed the point size chosen for the game and cannot fall more than 2 points under the point size chosen for the event. Players must incorporate all bonus warjack or warbeast points in their army list(s) point total. A 50-point Kaelyssa army, for example, must include 55 to 57 points of models.
			</p>
			<p>
				Players can bring one or two lists, the second list is optional. All lists must be led by warcasters/warlocks from the same faction. Mercenary players can use different contracts or theme forces for their lists. Minion players can use different pacts or theme forces for their lists. Players cannot include the same version of a model or unit with FA:C in more than one list. The original and epic incarnation(s) of a character do not count as the same version of a model. Any player decided model relationships (attached, client, marshaled, etc.) must be specified in the list and cannot change between rounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				SR2012 contains scenarios which use reinforcements. Reinforcements are additional models added to a player’s army list(s) that are only used in scenarios with the reinforcements artifice. These points must be represented in a player’s army list(s) although reinforcements scenarios may not be played. Detailed rules are found in the artifices section (p.XX)
			</p>
			<p>
				SR2012 allows all released Theme Forces to be used. Anyone using a theme force must have the Theme Force available for the TO’s reference (in order to verify the army list) and for the opponent’s reference (in order to view the Theme Force’s special rules). Permission is hereby granted to photocopy the Theme Forces section from the Forces of WARMACHINE and HORDES books as well as any theme forces appearing in No Quarter Magazine for personal, non-commercial use only and subject to the terms found within those original source materials.
			</p>
		<h3>Modeling and Painting</h3>
			<p>				
				All models used in Privateer Press organized play events must be Privateer Press miniatures from the WARMACHINE or HORDES ranges. The miniatures must be fully assembled on the appropriately-sized base for which the model was designed. Any non-Privateer Press models, unassembled miniatures, or inappropriately based models are not permitted.
			</p>
			<p>				
				Models that have not yet been released to the general public at the time of the event are not permitted. The Extreme versions of models are perfectly acceptable for use in organized play.
			</p>
			<p>				
				Privateer Press encourages players to have a fully painted force on the table. Games with painted armies are more interesting to watch and generally enhance the experience for all. Although painting is not required, players should take this chance to show off all aspects of the hobby.
			</p>
		<h3>Model Conversions</h3>
			<p>				
				Playing with a uniquely individualized and painted force is one of the most rewarding aspects of the hobby. Just as with information disclosure and sportsmanship, players are expected to be unambiguous about model representation. The following rules must be adhered to when using converted models in organized play. These rules are meant not to limit a player’s modeling options but rather to allow creativity without generating an environment that could become confusing during game play. <strong>At his discretion, an event organizer may make exceptions to these rules to approve any reasonable conversion.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				A converted model must contain a majority of parts from the WARMACHINE or HORDES model for which the rules were written. For example, a Testament of Menoth conversion must be comprised mostly of parts from the Testament of Menoth model. The end result of any conversion must be something that is clearly identifiable as the intended miniature and accurately represents its weapons and equipment as listed in its rules. Any conversions must be clearly pointed out to your opponent before the game to avoid confusion.
			</p>
			<p>
				On warrior models, converting and swapping weapons is acceptable provided the new weapon represents the same type of weapon replaced (like swapping one sword for another). Anything relating to a weapon’s specific rules must be maintained to avoid confusion on the tabletop. For example, a weapon with Chain Weapon must still be modeled as a chain-style weapon, and a weapon’s length must be considered when converting weapons with Reach.
			</p>
			<p>
				Weapons cannot be swapped on warjack and warbeast models. Since many of the ‘jacks and beasts utilize the same chassis or torso, the weapons are the most identifiable part of the model when looking across the tabletop. Converting warjacks and warbeasts is still encouraged, but the aesthetics of the weapons must be maintained. Modifying weapons is permitted, as long as the end result is easily identifiable as the intended warjack or warbeast’s proper weapon.
			</p>
			<p>
				The models with “upgrade kit” blisters are an exception to the standard conversion rules. Because the parts in these blisters define an entirely separate model for rules purposes, all parts must be clearly visible on the model for legal tournament use. For example, a helljack with one claw and one harpoon is not Malice. The model must have the correct head, harpoon blade, and all three spirit parts from the Malice blister in order to be considered Malice.
			</p>
			<p>
				Miniatures must be on their appropriately-sized WARMACHINE/ HORDES base, but scenic details may be added. The base’s perimeter must always be considered when modeling scenic details. While scenic elements may overhang the base’s edge, the base itself, not the scenic elements, are used for all measurements. The edge of a model’s base must not obscured to the point that accurate measuring becomes difficult or impossible.			
			</p>
		<h3>Sportsmanship</h3>
			<p>				
				A fair and honest in-game environment is required in order for everyone to have fun. Players must accurately execute the rules of the game and fully cooperate with opponents to honestly answer any questions that arise before and during the game. Players are also responsible for holding their opponents to the same standards.
			</p>
			<p>
				The TO will not be able to observe every game. If your opponent is doing something that is making you uncomfortable—stalling, bending the rules, or outright cheating—tell your opponent about it. Explain what they can do to remedy the situation in order to maintain a fair, honest and fun in-game environment. If the behavior continues or a dispute arises call the TO and explain the situation. The TO always has the final word on rules questions or debates. Players must accept all rulings made by the TO whether or not they agree.
			</p>
			<p>
				Players must present a mature and polite demeanor to their opponents and the TO. Failure to do so will result in immediate disqualification. A TO may also disqualify a player for any incident that is deemed unsporting. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive or abusive conduct, bullying, cheating, constant rules arguments, improper play, stalling, and other inappropriate actions. Disqualified players are not eligible for any awards or prizes and are barred from further participation in the event and any other related events.
			</p>
			<p>
				Occasionally circumstances will prompt a player to concede a game during a tournament. Concessions are not recommended since there is almost always a chance for victory. In the case of a concession the winning player will be awarded a win, half the control points (rounding up) for a scenario win and army points destroyed based on an assassination using current board conditions. The player who conceded will receive a loss and no points in any category. A TO may disqualify a player from a tournament if a concession is deemed unsportsmanlike.			
			</p>
	<h2>TO Responsibilities</h2>
		<h3>Schedule</h3>
			<p>
				When estimating the overall length of a tournament, a TO should add extra time for each round to cover the variable, allow time to do pairings, get people to their new tables, and get the next round started.
			</p>
		<h3>Number of Rounds</h3>
			<p>				
				The event will run until one player has more tournament points than any other player at the end of a round. Once this condition is met, the event ends without additional games.
			</p>
			<p>
				Players participate in a timed format with all players participating in every round. The number of players participating in the tournament determines the maximum number of games usually required to determine a winner.			
			</p>

					<td>5-round event</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>33 to 64</td>
					<td>6-round event</td>
				</tr>
		<h3>First Round Pairings</h3>
			<p>
				Shuffle all the tournament record sheets together. Take the top two sheets and set them to one side. This gives you the first pairing. Without shuffling the pile again, remove the next two sheets and repeat the process until all players have an opponent. If you have an odd number of players, see “Byes & Odd Number of Players” below.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you have completed the pairings, note the opposing player’s ID on each player’s sheet to track that player’s opponents. Record the tournament point and control point scores for each player when the round ends. Ignore the subtotal boxes for now; they only matter for rounds after the first.
			</p>
		<h3>Subsequent Pairings</h3>
			<p>
				From here on, all pairings and ranks are based on tournament point subtotals and pairings from previous rounds. After all games in the previous round have been completed, sort the tournament record sheets into piles based on the number of tournament points. Shuffle each pile.
			</p>
			<p>
				Take the top sheet of the pile with the greatest number of tournament points and choose the first opponent in the pile he has not already played. Set this pair aside and repeat the process. When you reach the end of a pile move to the next pile. If a pile has an odd number of players, pair the last player against someone from the next-highest tournament point pile – do not do pair down a player more than once per event. Again, once you have all the pairings, write the opposing player’s name in the appropriate column on each player’s sheet. It may take several attempts to find pairings that avoid duplicating match-ups.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some TOs use additional criteria for their pairings. Keep in mind that any additional criteria must come after matching players with the same number of tournament points who have not already played one another.
			</p>
		<h3>Byes & Odd Number of Players</h3>
			<p>
				Steamroller games take place between two players. In the case of an odd number of players, one player will receive a bye. A player receiving a bye sits out of the current round and receives 1 tournament point, half the control points (rounded up) for a scenario win and half (rounding up) of the army point level for the event.
			</p>
			<p>
				The TO will randomly determine which player receives the bye if a tournament begins with an odd number of players. In subsequent rounds, the TO will randomly select a player from those with the lowest tournament point totals. The TO should ensure that the same player does not receive a bye more than once per event.

			<p>
				Each round in a Steamroller event has a variable round length. Before each round begins, the TO rolls a d3 and multiplies the result by the turn extension length for the event size – this is the variable. A d6 roll is then made to determine whether the variable will be subtracted from (result of 1-3) or added to (result of 4-6) the base round length (shown above) to determine the overall round length.
			</p>
			<p>
				During rounds that use scenarios with the reinforcements artifice TOs will add two extensions to the overall round length after the variable is subtracted or added. In this case do not exceed the maximum round length of base round length +3 extensions. The TO will not announce the result of this roll or reveal the amount of time remaining in a game to players.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the time for a round has expired, the TO calls “dice down.” If a player is in the process of moving a model, he finishes that movement, then the turn and game end. If the player is in the process of making a roll of any kind, he completes that single roll, then the turn and game end. If the roll is an attack roll that directly hits its target, resolve the direct hit damage roll as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				At dice down resolve all end of turn effects that would occur including the removal of models if applicable. Models that have not entered play yet or were removed from the table do not enter play and do not count as destroyed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dice down or assassination prompts a final iteration of scenario scoring even though the game is over. Assassination victories always take priority over a scenario win.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a game does not have a clear winner after dice down, check the scenario for how to determine the winner. The TO should instruct all players how the tiebreaker system, described in the SR2012 scenario reference sheet, works before the tournament begins.
			</p>
		<h3>Turn Timing</h3>
			<p>
				Steamroller also uses a timed turn length to ensure a fair play environment. Players in each game use a timer to track the fixed amount of time available for each turn. This time limit is based on the point size of the event. A player’s timer begins after the resolution of continuous effects.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a player is executing a model/unit’s normal movement when his turn time expires, he finishes moving that model/unit, then his turn ends. If the player is in the process of making a roll of any kind after movement is complete, he completes that single roll, then his turn ends. If the roll is an attack roll that directly hits its target, resolve the direct hit damage roll as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a player moves a model, rolls dice or takes significant time to make decisions during the other player’s turn, the player whose turn it is has the option of stopping the clock while these actions are resolved.edge, 
			</p>
		<h3>Turn Extension</h3>
			<p>
				Once per game, each player may extend his turn length with an extension. A player can extend his turn length by declaring he is doing so during his turn. After the current turn time expires, the active player’s opponent resets the clock for the turn extension, then the active player continues his turn. Extensions cannot extend a turn past the total round time.
			</p>
			<p>
				During rounds that use scenarios with the reinforcements artifice each player is granted a 2nd extension. The 2nd extension is the same duration as a normal extension and cannot be combined with another extension on the same turn.es us
			</p>
	<h2>Scenarios</h2>
		<h3>Scenario Selection</h3>
			<p>				
				Steamroller 2012 contains six groups of scenarios. The scenarios in each group have similar objectives. In order to ensure that tournaments contain a variety of different scenario types, TOs must select a scenario from each group before they can choose from the same group again.
			</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>Round</td>
					<td>Group Choices Available</td>
					<td>Group Chosen</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>

			</table>
			<p>			
				TOs should choose scenarios before a tournament to ensure that they have the required materials for those scenarios. The selected scenarios can be played in any order. You may also use the random scenario table below.
			</p>
			<p>
				Scenarios cannot be repeated in a standard tournament. All players play the same scenario each round. The TO keeps the upcoming scenario secret until the start of each round of games.
			</p>
			<p>
				During each round the TO should provide at least one copy of the scenario being played for every four players (every two tables) in the event. After declaring the scenario, the TO will read the rules for that scenario aloud. The TO should answer questions concerning the scenario before the round begins. Players are responsible for making sure they understand the scenario.
			</p>
			<p>
				TOs should stress that it is imperative all players pursue both the scenario and assassination victory conditions during the game as players do not know when the round time is going to expire.d ga

		<h3>Deployment</h3>
			<p>
				SR2012 has added flank scenarios that use flank deployment illustrated in the diagram below. Mechanics that are measured from a player’s board edge or back of deployment zone can use a point on the board edge indicated below.
			</p>
			<img src="/images/deployment-flank.jpg" alt="Flank Deployment Scenario" width="" />
			<p>
				SR2012 also contains radial scenarios. Mechanics that are measured from a player’s board edge or back of deployment zone can use a point on either of the two board edges indicated below
			</p>
			<img src="/images/deployment-radial.jpg" alt="Flank Deployment Scenario" width="" />
				<p>
					In order to mitigate the initiative advantage of the first player, the deployment zones in SR2012 are different sizes based on turn order.
				</p>
				<p>
					In standard and flank deployment the first player has a 7½ deployment zone (13½ AD) and the second player has a 10½ deployment zone (16½ AD). Theme force bonuses do not extend the width of flank deployment zones.
				</p>
				<p>
					In radial deployment the first player has a 17½ deployment zone (23½ AD) and the second player has a 20½ deployment zone (26½ AD).~1	
				</p>
		<h3>Terrain</h3>
			<p>
				Terrain is a key element for games of Warmachine and Hordes. Terrain pieces should present choices to both players but should not give an undue advantage to either. To reinforce this principle terrain should be relatively symmetrical on a table. For example if one side of the board contains a forest, a hill and a linear obstacle then the other side should contain terrain with similar properties.
			</p>
			<p>
				An average table should contain 5-7 pieces of terrain that are close enough to prevent large open areas without unduly constricting movement. The size of terrain pieces is also important; no piece should be insignificantly small or extremely large. A piece of terrain should vary from 4 to 8 inches in length and width when measured. There are always exceptions to these rules but keep them in mind when choosing terrain for your venue.
			</p>
			<p>
				The type, volume, and placement of terrain are up to the TO, but the following guidelines must be followed when setting up tables:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not place terrain within deployment zone areas. This does not apply to Advance Deployment areas.</li>
				<li>All terrain pieces must be placed at least 3½ away from other terrain pieces. This includes terrain pieces granted by Theme Force bonuses.</li>
				<li>Do not place impassable terrain within zones when playing scenarios that use them. Note that all other terrain types can be placed within the zones.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				TOs can choose whether to fully represent the zones presented in the scenario packet with templates or mark the corners of rectangular zones or the center point of circular zones.
			</p>
			<p>
				If center or corner markers are used, players may measure the zone whenever it is relevant to fulfilling scenario conditions. Any attempted abuse of this mechanic is grounds for disqualification. If a scenario zone marker is inadvertently moved during play pause the clock and reset its position. If scenario scoring occurred while a marker was in an incorrect position the control points stand, even if this error is noticed after the fact.tu		
			</p>
		<h3>Artifices</h3>
			<p>
				SR2012 introduces artifices to scenario play. Artifices are mandatory additional rules present in certain scenarios.
			</p>
				<h4>1. Kill Box </h4>
					<p>
						If a player ends his turn with a friendly warcaster/warlock within 10” of any board edge, starting on the first player’s 2nd turn, then that warcaster/warlock is destroyed.		
					</p>
				<h4>2. Reinforcements</h4>
					<p>
						Additional models, up to a specified point value (see below), added to a player’s army list(s) that are only used in scenarios with the reinforcements artifice. These models are separate from the main part of each list and must be included, with battlegroup/marshal affiliation if applicable, even though reinforcements scenarios may not be played. Reinforcements follow the normal Field Allowance rules for their corresponding list. Players can field reinforcements without using all of the reinforcement points available. Reinforcements must follow the restrictions of any theme force to which they are added, and benefit from any applicable bonuses (including Field Allowance) but are not counted toward satisfying tier requirements.
					</p>
					<p>
						Warcasters, Warlocks, models/units with the Pre-Deployment, Attached, Companion rule or models/unit that cannot begin the game in play cannot be Reinforcements. Reinforcement models cannot be bonded. Reinforcements lose the Ambush ability. Reinforcements with the Prey ability choose their Prey target after all players are deployed.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the maintenance phase, on a player’s 2nd
					</p>
					<p>
						turn or later, these models can be placed within 3” of any point on the reinforcements line shown in the scenario diagram. All of a player’s reinforcements must be placed on the same turn.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the turn that reinforcement warjacks enter the game, during the focus allocation step of your Control Phase, they are allocated 3 free focus. This focus is only applied to warjacks controlled by a warcaster that started the game in play and cannot exceed the normal focus allocation limit. On the turn that reinforcement warbeasts enter the game they can be forced while outside of their controlling warlock’s control area. This rule only applies to warbeasts controlled by a warlock that started the game in play.ion. If

					Players can ask to see their opponent’s lists at any time, including before final list selection, before the start of the game, and during play. A player must take care not to disrupt the flow of the game while doing this. All models in each list must be presented to an opponent upon request before list selection.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before the starting roll the players secretly choose one of their lists after the pairings and scenarios for the game have been announced. Players must conceal the card for their selected warcaster or warlock on the table. Players cannot change their lists after making this selection. Both players reveal their lists simultaneously followed by the starting roll.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both players roll a D6 for the starting roll. The player with the highest result can choose to be the first or second player. The second player chooses his table edge. The first player deploys first and takes the first turn. TOs have the option to predetermine table sides for players in order to save time during deployment.
				</p>
		<h3>Final Standings</h3>
					Players s<p>
						core tournament points based on their performance during each game. A player gains 1 tournament point for a win and 0 for a loss or draw. Tournament points determine a player’s current standing in a tournament.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the case of two players with the same number of tournament points, determine which one ranks higher by calculating strength of schedule. Count the tournament points scored divided by the number of games played by each opponent of the tied players. If one of the player’s opponents did not score any tournament points use a value equal to 1 divided by the total number of rounds in the event.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, after four rounds Jason and Doug are tied for second place. To break the tie, the TO adds up the tournament points divided by number of games played for Jason’s opponents during the previous four rounds and compares the total to the same metric for Doug’s opponents.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player whose opponents have the highest total score has the best strength of schedule score and earns the higher rank. If strength of schedule is the same for both players, the player who accrued the most control points throughout the tournament earns the higher rank. If control points are the same for both players, the player who accrued the most enemy army points destroyed throughout the tournament earns the higher rank. When counting destroyed army points, use the destruction scoring rules found on page xx.
