A player owns the models in his fielded army list and any models created by abilities of those models. There are no additional requirements for solos, warjacks, or warbeasts. For a non-warcaster/warlock unit to control a zone, the unit must contain 50% or more of its starting number (rounding up) and all those remaining models must be within the zone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A player dominates the zone if he owns one or more warcaster/warlock models within it and no opponent contests it. When two or more warcasters/warlocks dominate the zone, only the active player's warcaster/warlock dominates. A player cannot control and dominate the zone in the same turn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A player must control at least one model within the zone to contest that zone. Warcasters, warlocks, inert warjacks, wild warbeasts, models that are fleeing, and models that are out of formation cannot contest. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When a player gains a Pressure Point his opponent's warcaster(s)/warlock(s) suffer 5 points of magical damage  that cannot be transferred. Additionally, the warcaster(s)/warlock(s) lose Tough, cannot be healed, and cannot have damage removed for one round. If the Pressure Point is gained by dominating the zone, increase the damage suffered by 2 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</specialRules>

	<specialRules>Place two flags and two Ammunition Cache objectives in accordance with the diagram below. The objective on Player 1's side of the table is a friendly Faction model to Player 1 and vice versa. Starting on the second player's second turn, at the end of each player's turn a player earns control points (CP) as follows:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artifice&lt;/strong&gt;: Kill Box&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flag: Control = 1 CP, Dominate = 2 CP &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enemy Objective: Destroyed/Removed from Play = 1 CP (once per objective) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</specialRules>
	<tacticalTips>Enemy objectives contest flags within 4 inches.&lt;p&gt;Only the active player scores when multiple players dominate the same zone or flag</tacticalTips>
