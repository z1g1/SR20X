<h1>SR 2011 Scenario Refernce Sheet</h1>
		<h2>Scenario Glossary</h2>
			<p><b>Scenario Diagrams:</b>Each player’s deployment zone and the scoring areas or objectives for the scenario are depicted. The first (red) and second (blue) player are assigned a color in the diagram. The scoring areas are also color-coded by player in some scenarios. In these scenarios a player must control or contest the areas that match his own color in the diagram.

			<p><b>Starting number:</b> The number of models that a model/unit choice provides based on the army point cost paid. If a model/unit doesn’t begin the game with all purchased
			models in play, the starting number is still considered to be the number stated on the stat card for the point cost paid.

			<p><b>Own:</b> Models listed, or created by effects, within a player’s fielded army list.

			<p><b>Control:</b> The rules for control vary depending on the scenario and the type of scoring area (zone or flag) used.  Ignore inert warjacks, wild warbeasts, fleeing models and models that you own that are under the control of your opponent when checking for control conditions.

			<p><b>Contest:</b> A player must own at least one model within a scoring area in order to contest that area or within 4” of a flag to contest that flag. Inert warjacks, wild warbeasts, and fleeing models cannot contest.

			<p><b>Zone:</b> Also called a “scoring area.” A region of the game table defined within the scenario rules. Players seek to “control” these zones or “contest” a zone so that an opponent does not control that zone. A player controls a zone if he owns one or more models within the zone and the opponent has no models within the same zone.  There are no additional requirements for warcasters, warlocks, warjacks, or warbeasts. For a unit to control a zone the unit must contain 50% or more of its starting number (rounding up) and all remaining models must be within the same zone.  For a solo to control a zone, it must have an army point cost of 1 or more. For solo choices that consist of multiple models, divide the cost of the solo choice by the number of models to see if each model is worth at least 1 point. For multiple model solo choices to control a zone the choice must contain 50% or more of its starting number of models (rounding up) and all remaining models must be within the same zone.

			<p><b>Flag (40 mm base):</b> All flags are models with the following qualities:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Cannot be targeted, damaged, moved, placed, or removed from play</li>
					<li>Incorporeal, stationary, medium-based models</li>
					<li>Immune to all in-game effects; do not activate</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A player controls a flag if he owns one or more models B2B with the flag and the opponent has no models within 4" of that flag. There are no additional requirements for warcasters, warlocks, warjacks, or warbeasts.  If the B2B model is a member of a unit, the unit must contain 50% or more of its starting number (rounding up) and all remaining models must also be within 4" of the flag.

				<p>If the B2B model is a solo it must have an army point cost of 1 or more. For solo choices that consist of multiple models, divide the cost of the solo choice by the number of models to see if each model is worth at least 1 point. For multiple model solo choices to control a flag the choice must contain 50% or more of its starting number of models (rounding up) and all remaining models must also be within 4? of the flag.

			<p><b>Objective (50 mm base):</b> Some scenarios will add additional qualities to objectives or contradict these properties; in those cases the scenario takes precedence.  All objectives are models with the following qualities:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Cannot be targeted by attacks or damaged on the first round</li>
					<li>Non-living, non-warrior, stationary, large-based models</li>
					<li>Friendly model to all other models</li>
					<li>DEF 5/ARM 20/Damage: 15</li>
					<li>360 degree front arc</li>
					<li>May be moved by throws, slams, pushes, etc.</li>
					<li>Cannot be placed, knocked down, or removed from play</li>
					<li>Cannot channel</li>
					<li>Do not activate, suffer continuous effects, or suffer collateral damage</li>
				</ul>
		<h2>Victory and Tiebreakers</h2>
			<p><b>Assassination Victory:</b> When only one player owns warcasters/warlocks remaining in play, that player immediately wins the match.

			<p><b>Scenario Victory:</b> When a player has fulfilled the victory conditions described in the scenario, that player immediately wins the match.

			<p><b>1st Tiebreaker:</b> If time runs out before a player has won the match, the player who owns the most warcasters/warlocks remaining in play wins the match. If both players own the same number of warcasters/warlocks in play, check the 2nd tiebreaker to determine the match winner.

			<p><b>2nd Tiebreaker:</b> The player who has the most control points wins the match. If both players have the same number of control points, check the 3rd tiebreaker to determine the match winner.

			<p><b>3rd Tiebreaker:</b> Tally the army point value of the models/units owned by each player within the designated scenario scoring area. Ignore inert warjacks, wild warbeasts, and fleeing models when checking 3rd tiebreaker conditions. The player with more army points wins the match. If both players have the same number of army points, check the 4th tiebreaker to determine the match winner.
				<ul>
					<li>Warjacks/Warbeasts: Points equal to the army point cost of the model within the scoring area.</li>
					<li>Solos: Points equal to the army point cost of the model within the scoring area. If a solo choice consists of multiple models, ignore solo choices that have fewer than 50% (rounding up) of their starting number remaining in play when counting army points. All remaining models must be within the scoring area for the solo choice’s value to be counted.</li>
					<li>
						<p>Units and Unit Attachments: Points equal to the unit’s army point cost. Ignore units that have fewer than 50% (rounding up) of their starting number remaining in play when counting army points. At least half (rounding up) of the remaining models must be within the scoring area.

						<p>Models with the Attachment ability add to the unit’s value and also add to the number of models needed. For example, ten Long Gunners need five or more models in play to be worth 10 points, and twelve Long Gunners including their unit attachment need six or more models to be worth 12 points.
					</li>	
					<li>Warcasters/Warlocks: 5 points for each warcaster or warlock (regardless of warjack and warbeast bonus points) within the scoring area. If a warcaster or warlock choice consists of multiple models, all the models with the warcaster or warlock subtype must be within the scoring area.  Models automatically included with the warcaster or warlock choice without the warcaster or warlock subtype do not affect warcaster/warlock scoring.</li>
				</ul>
			<p><b>4th Tiebreaker:</b> Tally each player’s army points destroyed as described below. The player who suffered more army points destroyed loses the match.
				<ul>
					<li>Destroyed models/units are worth their army points value.</li>
					<li>Units below 50% of their starting number (rounding up) are worth 50% of their army points (rounding up) including all attachments.</li>
					<li>Count the full army points value for inert warjacks and wild warbeasts.</li>
					<li>Warcasters and warlocks are worth 5 army points.</li>
				</ul>
