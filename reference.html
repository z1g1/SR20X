        In Steamroller tournaments, players face off in a series of WARMACHINE/HORDES games and pit their skills against a gauntlet of opponents to determine who will emerge victorious. Steamroller is ideal for groups of 8 to 128 players and promotes fast and furious play while stressing the ability to adapt to a variety of scenarios.

        Players participating in a Steamroller 2014 (SR2013) event must bring all their own models, stat cards, dice, measuring devices, markers, and templates they require for play. Tokens representing in-game effects such as focus, fury, spells, and abilities are required and must be kept adjacent to the corresponding model on the table. Players should also bring a copy of the SR2013 scenario reference sheet for use during the tournament.

        Players can also use the War Room application during SR2014 events. When using War Room during an event a player can: mark damage on War Room cards instead of physical stat cards; reference model and game rules from War Room instead of physical stat cards or rulebooks; and show Event Organizers (EOs) and opponents a Theme Force's rules on War Room. Players must still share their model stats, damage, and so on with opponents, whether or not anopponent has War Room. If a player's War Room device fails during a game and the information cannot be recovered in a timely manner, the player concedes that game.  

        <h3><a id="army lists">army lists</a></h3>
        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>

        Players must bring two copies of their army list(s) complete with point costs. Army list point totals cannot exceed the point size chosen for the game and cannot fall more than 2 points (including warjack/warbeast points) under the point size chosen for the event. For example a 50-point Kaelyssa army must include 55 to 57 points of models.

        Players can bring a second list if they choose. All lists must be led by warcasters/warlocks from the same faction.  Mercenary players can use different contracts or Theme Forces for their lists. Minion players can use different pacts or Theme Forces for their lists. Players cannot include the same version of a model or unit with FA C in more than one list. The original and epic incarnation(s) of a character do not count as the same version of a model. Any player-determined model relationships (attached, client, marshaled, etc.) must be specified in the list and cannot change between rounds.

        SR2014 allows all released Theme Forces to be used. Anyone using a Theme Force must have the Theme Force available for the event organizer's reference (in order to verify the army list) and for the opponent's reference (in order to view the Theme Force's special rules). Permission is hereby granted to photocopy the Theme Forces section from the WARMACHINE and HORDES expansion books as well as any Theme Forces appearing in  No Quarter  magazine for personal, non-commercial use only and subject to the terms found within those original source materials.

        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>

        All models used in Privateer Press organized play events must be Privateer Press miniatures from the WARMACHINE or HORDES ranges. The miniatures must be fully assembled on the appropriately sized base for which the model was designed. Any non-Privateer Press models, unassembled miniatures, or inappropriately based models are not permitted.  The extreme versions of models are acceptable for use in organized play. The Druid Gone Wilder promotional miniature is a legal substitute for the Circle Orboros Druid Wilder solo. To use the miniature in this capacity, the player will also need access to the Druid Wilder stat card so that both players can see the model's stats and abilities. The Bombardier Bombshell promotional miniature is a legal substitute for a Khador Man-O-War Bombardier trooper model. To use the miniature in this capacity, the player will also need access to the ManO-War Bombardier stat card so that both players can see the model's stats and abilities. Additionally, the player's unit must clearly show which model within the unit is the Unit Commander model. For example: You could replace multiple models in your original Khador Man-O-War Bombardier unit with Bombardier Bombshell models, including the leader, as long as you clearly indicated in some manner which model is the Unit Commander.

        Privateer Press encourages players to have a fully painted force on the table. Games with painted armies are more interesting to watch and generally enhance the experience for all. Although painting is not required, players are encouraged to show off all aspects of the hobby.  Models that have not yet been released to the general public at the time of the event are not permitted unless those models are readily available at the event venue (such as conventionrelease models in tournaments at that convention

        <h3><a id="model conversions">model conversions</a></h3>
        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>
        Players must be unambiguous about model representation.  The following rules must be adhered to when using converted models in organized play. These rules are meant not to limit a player's modeling options but rather to allow creativity without generating an environment that could become confusing during game play.  <strong>At his discretion, an event organizer can make exceptions to these rules to approve any reasonable conversion.</strong>   

        A converted model must contain a majority of parts from the WARMACHINE or HORDES model for which the rules were written. For example, a Testament of Menoth conversion must be composed mostly of parts from the Testament of Menoth model. The end result of any conversion must be clearly identifiable as the intended miniature and accurately represent its weapons and equipment as listed in its rules.  Any conversions must be clearly pointed out to your opponent before the game to avoid confusion. 

        On warrior models, converting and swapping weapons is acceptable provided the new weapon represents the same type of weapon replaced (like swapping one sword for another). Anything relating to a weapon's specific rules must be maintained to avoid confusion on the tabletop.  For example, a weapon with Chain Weapon must still be modeled as a chain-style weapon, and a weapon's length must be considered when converting weapons with Reach.

        Weapons cannot be swapped on warjack and warbeast models. Since many of the 'jacks and beasts utilize the same chassis or torso, the weapons are the most identifiable part of the model when looking across the tabletop. Converting warjacks and warbeasts is still encouraged, but the aesthetics of the weapons must be maintained. Modifying weapons is permitted, as long as the end result is easily identifiable as the intended warjack or warbeast's proper weapon.

        Models/units with  upgrade  blisters are an exception to the standard model conversion rules in a number of ways. Because the parts in these blisters define an entirely separate set of stats and abilities, the upgrade parts must be clearly visible on the model/unit matching the upgrade stat card in order to be legal for tournament use. For example, a helljack with one claw and one harpoon is not Malice.  The model must have the correct head, harpoon blade, and all three spirit parts from the Malice upgrade in order to be considered Malice. Additionally, once a model/unit has been converted, it can only be fielded as that model/ unit. For example, a Warpwolf with the parts from the Ghetorix upgrade is not an acceptable conversion for use with a Warpwolf Stalker stat card. Lastly, in the case of unit attachment or weapon attachment upgrade, the model(s) that use the upgrade stat card must follow these rules to be legal for tournament use, but the base unit follows the standard conversion policy for warrior model conversions, above. For example, a Black Dragon Officer & Standard must always use the Black Dragon upgrade stat card and an Iron Fang Pikemen Officer & Standard must always use the Iron Fang Pikemen Officer & Standard stat card, but an Iron Fang Pikemen unit without a UA uses its standard stat card whether or not the models have Black Dragon shields (or any other reasonable conversion).

        Miniatures must be on their appropriately sized WARMACHINE/HORDES base, but scenic details can be added. The base's perimeter must always be considered when modeling scenic details. While it is acceptable for scenic elements to overhang the base's edge, the base itself and not the scenic elements is used for all measurements. The edge of a model's base must not obscured to the point that accurate measuring becomes difficult or impossible.

        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>
        A fair and honest in-game environment is required in order for everyone to have fun. Players must accurately execute the rules of the game and fully cooperate with opponents to honestly answer any questions that arise before and during the game. Players are also responsible for holding their opponents to the same standards. 

        The EO will not be able to observe every game. If your opponent is doing something that is making you uncomfortable- stalling, bending the rules, or outright cheating-tell your opponent about it. Explain what he can do to remedy the situation in order to maintain a fair, honest, and fun in-game environment. If the behavior continues or a dispute arises, call the EO and explain the situation. The EO always has the final word on rules questions or debates. Players must accept all rulings made by the EO whether or not they agree.

        Players must present a mature and polite demeanor to their opponents and the EO. Failure to do so will result in immediate disqualification. An EO can also disqualify a player for any incident that is deemed unsporting. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive or abusive conduct, bullying, cheating, constant rules arguments, improper play, stalling, and other inappropriate actions. Disqualified players are not eligible for any awards or prizes and are barred from further participation in the event and any other related events.

        Occasionally circumstances will prompt a player to concede a game during a tournament. Concessions are not recommended since there is almost always a chance for victory. In the case of a concession, the winning player will be awarded a win, half the control points (rounding up) for a scenario win, and army points destroyed based on an assassination using current board conditions. The player who conceded will receive a loss and no points in any category. An EO can disqualify a player from a tournament if a concession is deemed unsportsmanlike.

        When estimating the overall length of a tournament, an EO should add extra time for each round to cover the variable, allow time to do pairings, get people to their new tables, and get the next round started. Ensure that all the required materials for the planned scenarios are prepared ahead of time to avoid delays.

        The  event will run until one player has more tournament points than any other player at the end of a round. Once this condition is met, the event ends without additional games.  Players participate in a timed format with all players participating in every round. The number of players participating in the tournament determines the maximum number of games usually required to determine a winner

        Shuffle all the tournament record sheets together. Take the top two sheets and set them to one side. This gives you the first pairing. Without shuffling the pile again, remove the next two sheets and repeat the process until all players have an opponent. If you have an odd number of players, see "Byes and Odd Number of Players" below. Once you have completed the pairings, note the opposing player's name on each player's sheet to track that player's opponents. Record the tournament (1 for a win, 0 for loss or tie), control, and army point scores for each player when the round ends.

        <h3><a id="subsequent pairings">subsequent pairings</a></h3>

        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>

        From here on, all pairings and ranks are based on tournament point subtotals and pairings from previous rounds. After all games in the previous round have been completed, sort the tournament record sheets into piles based on the number of tournament points. Shuffle each pile.

        Take the top sheet of the pile with the greatest number of tournament points and choose the first opponent in the pile he has not already played. Set this pair aside and repeat the process. When you reach the end of a pile move to the next pile. If a pile has an odd number of players, pair the last player against someone from the next-highest tournament point pile. Do not do this with any individual player more than once per event. Again, once you have all the pairings, write the opposing player's name in the appropriate column on each player's sheet. It might take several attempts to find pairings that avoid duplicating match-ups.

        <h3><a id="byes and odd number of players">byes and odd number of players</a></h3>
        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>

        In the case of an odd number of players, one player will receive a bye. A player receiving a bye sits out of the current round and receives 1 tournament point, half the control points (rounded up) for a scenario win, and half the army point level (rounded up) for the event.

        The EO will randomly determine which player receives the bye if a tournament begins with an odd number of players.  In subsequent rounds, the EO will randomly select a player from those with the lowest tournament point totals. The EO should ensure that the same player does not receive a bye more than once per event.

        Each round in a Steamroller event has a variable  round length. Before each round begins, the EO rolls a d3 and multiplies the result by the turn extension length for the event size; this result is the variable. He then rolls a d6 to determine whether the variable will be subtracted from (on a result of 1-3) or added to (on a result of 4-6) the base round length (shown above) to determine the overall round length.  The EO will not announce the result of this roll or reveal the amount of time remaining in a game to players.

        After the time for a round has expired, the EO calls "dice down." If a player has declared the activation of a model/ unit or has already begun to physically move the model/ unit, he finishes movement for that model/unit, then the turn and game end. If the player is in the process of making a roll of any kind, he completes that single roll, then the turn and game end. If the roll is an attack roll that directly hits its target, resolve the direct hit damage roll as well. 

        At dice down, resolve all end-of-turn effects including the removal of models if applicable. Models that have not entered play yet or were removed from the table do not enter play and do not count as destroyed. Dice down or assassination prompts a final iteration of scenario scoring even though the game is over. Assassination victories always take priority over a scenario win. If a game does not have a clear winner after dice down, check the scenario for how to determine the winner.

        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>

        Steamroller also uses a timed turn length to ensure a fair play environment. Players in each game use a timer to track the fixed amount of time available for each turn. This time limit is based on the point size of the event. A player's timer begins after the resolution of continuous effects.

        If a player is moving a model when his turn time expires, he finishes moving that model and his turn ends. If the player is in the process of making a roll of any kind after movement is complete, he completes that single roll, then his turn ends. If the roll is an attack roll that directly hits its target, resolve the direct hit damage roll as well.

        When a player moves a model, rolls dice, or takes time to make decisions during the  other  player's turn, the player whose turn it is has the option of stopping the clock while these actions are resolved.

        Once  per game, each player can extend his turn length with an <strong>extension</strong>. A player can extend his turn length by declaring he is doing so during his turn. After the current turn time expires, the active player's opponent resets the clock for the turn extension, then the active player continues his turn. Extensions cannot extend a turn past total round time.

        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>

        Steamroller 2014 contains six groups of scenarios. The scenarios in each group have similar objectives. In order to ensure that tournaments contain a variety of different scenario types, EOs must select a scenario from each group before they can choose from the same group again.

        The EO should choose scenarios before a tournament to ensure he has the required materials for those scenarios. The selected scenarios can be played in any order. The random scenario table below can also be used.

        Scenarios cannot be repeated in a standard tournament. All players play the same scenario each round. The EO should not announce the round's scenario until the start of each round of games.

        During each round the EO should provide at least one copy of the scenario being played for every two tables in the event. The EO should answer questions concerning the scenario before the round begins. Players are responsible for making sure they understand the scenario.EOs should stress that it is imperative all players pursue both the scenario and assassination victory conditions during the game as players do not know when the round time is going to expire.

        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>

        Refer to the diagram in each scenario to set up a game. Each player's  board edge, deployment zone, objectives (circle), flags (triangle) and zones will be highlighted in that player's corresponding color (P1 = red, P2 = blue). Flags, zones, and objectives will be identified as friendly Faction, friendly, or enemy in the scenario rules.

        <h3><a id="terrain">terrain</a></h3>
        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>
        Terrain is a key element for games  of WARMACHINE and HORDES and should be relatively balanced on a table while still presenting a choice for the player who wins the starting roll. For example, if one side of the board contains a forest, a hill, and a linear obstacle, the other side should contain terrain that provides concealment, elevation, and cover as well but may be positioned in a more advantageous defensive position.

        As a general rule, an average table should contain five to seven pieces of terrain placed close enough to eliminate large open areas without unduly constricting movement. The size of terrain pieces is also important. No piece should be insignificantly small or extremely large; terrain pieces that range from 4? to 7? in length and width are best.

        The type, number, and placement of terrain pieces are up to the EO, but the following guidelines must be followed when setting up tables:

        Do not place terrain within deployment zone areas. This does not apply to Advance Deployment areas.

        All terrain pieces must be placed at least 3? away from other terrain pieces. This includes terrain pieces or wreck markers granted by Theme Force bonuses.

        Do not place impassable terrain within zones, within 4? of flags, or within 2? of objectives when playing scenarios that use them. Note that all other terrain types can be placed within these areas.

        EOs can choose whether to fully represent the zones presented in the scenario packet with templates or mark the corners of rectangular zones or the center point of circular zones. If center or corner markers are used, players can measure the zone whenever it is relevant to fulfilling scenario conditions. Any attempted abuse of this rule is grounds for disqualification. If an objective, flag, or zone is inadvertently moved, pause the clock and reset the zone marker's position.  If scenario scoring occurred while a marker was in an incorrect position the control points stand, even if this error is noticed after the fact.

        <strong><strong>Kill Box</strong></strong> Starting on the first player's second turn, if a player ends his own turn with a friendly warcaster/warlock completely within 14? of any board edge, his opponent immediately scores 2 control points. A player can measure 14? from any board edge during his warcaster/warlock's activation.

        <h3><a id="starting the game">starting the game</a></h3>
        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>

        Players can ask to see their opponent's lists at any time including before list selection, before the start of the game, and during play. A player must take care not to disrupt the flow of the game while doing this. All models in each list must be presented to an opponent upon request before list selection.

        After the pairings and scenarios for the game have been announced, but before the starting roll, each player secretly chooses one of his lists and conceals the card for the selected warcaster or warlock on the table. A player cannot change lists after making this selection. Both players simultaneously reveal their lists.

        Both players roll a d6 for the starting roll. The player with the higher result can choose to be the first or second player.  The second player chooses his table edge. The first player deploys first and takes the first turn. The EO has the option to predetermine table sides for players in order to save time during deployment.

        <h3><a id="game results">game results</a></h3>
        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>

        At the end of a game both players are required to enter the following information on their player record sheets. Record the name of your opponent, your result in the game (Win/ Loss/Draw), the list you played, the amount of control points you scored, and the number of your opponent's army points that were destroyed. Calculate the number of army points destroyed using the 4th tiebreaker rules from the scenario reference sheet. Please remember that battlegroup warjacks become inert and battlegroup warbeasts become wild upon the assassination of their controller and therefore count for the 4th tiebreaker total. Once this information is recorded report the results of the game to the EO. Also note that for the purposes of scoring the game a player cannot earn more control points than are required to win the scenario.

        <h3><a id="final standings">final standings</a></h3>
        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>

        Players score tournament points based on the outcome of each game. A player gains 1 tournament point for a win and 0 for a loss or draw. Tournament points determine a player's current standing in a tournament.

        In the case of two players with the same number of tournament points, determine which one ranks higher by calculating strength of schedule.

        Count the tournament points scored by each opponent of the tied players to determine strength of schedule.

        The player whose opponents have the highest total score has the best strength of schedule score and earns the higher rank. If strength of schedule is the same for both players, the player who accrued the most control points throughout the tournament earns the higher rank. If control points are also the same for both players, the player who accrued the most enemy army points destroyed throughout the tournament earns the higher rank.

        Steamroller  2014 (SR2013) provides an official format for Event Organizers (EOs) of WARMACHINE and HORDES events. We realize that not all communities are the same, so we have compiled this appendix to provide official variants to specific areas of the SR2013 document.

        These variants can be used to alter a single rule, or they can be combined to form a more casual or competitive format based on the preferences of the players, the needs of the venue, or event time constraints. No matter what choices you make, any combination of variants from this document will constitute an official SR2014 tournament format.

        Variant rules are available for the following sections of the SR2014 rules:
        <ol>
            <li>Army Lists</li>
            <li>Painting</li>
            <li>Number of Rounds</li>
            <li>Game Timing</li>

        This document will revisit several rules areas of the SR2014 document. A review of the baseline version of a rule will be listed followed by variant keyword(s) and the description of the variant(s). Not all sections of the SR2013 rules document have variant options. For example, players must always practice good sportsmanship, so no variants are available for playing outside the sportsmanship parameters set forth in the baseline SR2013 rules.

        SR2014 appendix variants make it easy for an EO to tailor events to the needs of a player community. By using the appropriate variant keywords, players can reference this document for details, which will help keep pre-tournament announcements concise.


        <h3><a id="1. army list variants">1. army list variants</a></h3>
        <div class="top-link"><small><a href="#top">Top</a></small></div>
        <strong>Baseline</strong> Second list optional. All lists are subject to the same point constraints and must be led by warcasters/warlocks from the same faction. Players cannot include the same version of a model or unit with FA C in more than one list.

        <strong>[X] List(s) Required</strong> Players must bring exactly X army lists and must play each army list at least once during the event.

        <strong>Characters Restricted</strong> Different versions of the same character model/unit cannot be included in more than one of a player's lists. (Example: A player cannot include Alexia, Mistress of the Witchfire in one list and Alexia Ciannor & the Risen in another.)

        <strong>Characters Unrestricted</strong> Models/units with FA C can be included in more than one list.


        <strong>Theme Forces: Tier [X] Required</strong> Players must use a Theme Force of Tier X or higher in all lists. Models/units with FA C can be included in more than one list (if included in more than one Theme Force).

        <strong>Divide and Conquer [X]</strong> Each list must be played at least X times during the tournament. Divide and Conquer events must also use the X Lists Required variant. The goal of this variant is to challenge players to use their lists equally prior to the final round so that a list decision is available. If this goal is not achievable based on the expected number of rounds Divide and Conquer is not recommended.

        <strong>Battlegroup Only</strong>  Army lists contain only battlegroup models and independent warjacks/warbeasts.

        <strong>Specialists</strong> Players can add a supplementary list of models/ units (specialists) to each of their army lists. Specialist model/ units lists are completely optional but cannot exceed the totals listed in the table below. These models are not used unless a player decides to substitute them for models/units in the corresponding base army list in accordance with the specialist rules. Specialists must be listed separately for each army list and must follow all Field Allowance (FA) rules, including Steamroller 2014 FA C requirements between lists. Specialist selections must be models/units with a separate physical copy of a card from models/units in the corresponding main list. 

        For example, listing the point cost required to increase a minimum unit in a list to a maximum unit by the addition of specialists is not permitted. Listing a Unit Attachment or Weapon Attachments to add to the minimum unit in the main list is permitted, however, since these models have a separate physical card that is not already in the main list and does not exceed FA. 

        The same rules apply for the removal of models in a list to facilitate the addition of specialists. Removals must be cardbased and cannot be accomplished by point reductions (such as the removal of models from a maximum unit) or the changing of point cost options such as a Drakhun's dismounted model.

        Specialists must follow the restrictions of any Theme Force to which they are added and benefit from any applicable bonuses (including Field Allowance). All relationships determined by the player (attached, marshaled, etc.) must be clearly identified for specialist model/units.

        After list selection is complete both players simultaneously reveal the card(s) of models that will be removed from and added to each player's selected list for the game. Specialist substitutions cannot result in an illegal army list.

            <li><strong>Basic Painting Required</strong> All models must be primed and basecoated. Players must present the intended final color scheme on all parts of the model. Bases can be unfinished.</li>
            <li><strong>Hardcore Painting Required</strong> For Hardcore tournaments, all the Steamroller "Modeling and Painting"and "Conversions" rules apply. In addition, all models must be completely painted. This means every model must be painted with a reasonable diversity of color and individual elements of the miniature must be distinguishable by color or shading. For instance, flesh must be a different color than hair or clothing; metal should be a different color than leather. The base is part of the model, so don't neglect it! Bases must be finished with sand or flock or otherwise modeled and painted.</li>
        </ul>
        Models that do not meet these requirements will not be eligible for play. Whether a model is completed is the decision of the EO. As a general rule, if someone feels the need to justify why a model is completed, it probably isn't.  In order to be eligible for any prizes that are awarded based on quality and technique the owning player must paint all presented models themselves.

            <li><strong>Baseline </strong> Basic round times are randomly decreased or increased by a variable (d3 x extension length) that is not revealed to players. During each game, one turn extension is allowed for each player. Dice down is called when round time is complete.
            <li><strong>No Time Limits</strong> Games are untimed. A round continues until all players have completed their games.</li>
            <li><strong>Relaxed Time Limits </strong> Use the baseline round, turn, and extension length of an event two sizes higher.</li>
            <li><strong>Casual Time Limits </strong> Use the baseline round, turn, and extension length of the event with the next-higher point size.</li>
            <li><strong>Hardcore Time Limits</strong> Use the baseline round, turn, and extension length of the event with the next-lower point size.</li>
            <li><strong>Frenzy Time Limits </strong> Use the baseline round, turn, and extension length of an event two sizes lower.</li>
            <li><strong>No Extensions </strong> The allowance of one turn extension per game is removed.</li>
            <li><strong>Death Clock</strong> Dice down is not called in Death Clock rounds. Instead of timing each turn, chess clocks are used. A clock with a player's total time (player clock) replaces individual turn lengths and the sum of both player clocks determines the expected end time for each round.</li>

        When army lists and deployment order for all games are determined both players can place their selected armies on the table outside their respective deployment zones. Upon notification by the EO the first player starts his clock and begins pre-deployment. When the first player's pre-deployment is complete he taps his clock to the second player, who completes his pre-deployment. All phases of deployment are completed in this manner until the second player's advance deployment is complete. At this time the second player taps his clock and the first player's first turn begins.

        When first players begin pre-deployment the judge will record the expected end time for the round based on the sum of both player clocks. <strong>In order to maintain the event schedule, players cannot pause the chess clock at any time.</strong>  If a judge's call is required, the judge, at his own discretion, can pause the chess clock when he arrives at the table. If the judge paused the clock he will restart it when his call is complete. Players who pause the chess clock will receive one warning and will lose their games upon a second infraction.

        A player must activate all his models each turn or risk disqualification. Declaring that a model/unit sacrifices its movement and action is acceptable. When a player moves a model, rolls dice, marks damage, or contemplates decisions during the other player's turn, the player whose turn it is has the option of switching the clock to his opponent's time while these actions are resolved. This rule is present for the sake of time equity versus action and should not be abused. A player should call a judge if concerned with an opponent's use of this rule.

        When scenario win conditions are met, a player can end his turn without activating any other models. If a player's clock runs out of time, that player loses the game; score the loss as an assassination victory using current table conditions.  When the expected end time for the round arrives, the judge will check on all remaining active games. Games with less than 5 minutes combined on both player clocks will play to completion. Games with more than 5 minutes combined on both player clocks will be declared a draw.

        When reinforcements are in use base round times are adjusted per the table below. Additionally, each player is granted a second extension. The second extension is the same duration as a normal extension and cannot be combined with another extension on the same turn.

        Reinforcement models/units must follow Field Allowance (FA) rules for their corresponding list; a model/unit's FA cannot be split between the main list and its reinforcements section. All model relationships determined by the player (attached, marshaled, etc.) must be clearly identified.  Reinforcements must follow the restrictions of any Theme Force to which they are added and benefit from any applicable bonuses (including Field Allowance) but are not counted toward satisfying tier requirements.

        Warcasters, warlocks, models/units with the Pre-Deployment or Attached rule, and models/unit that cannot begin the game in play cannot be reinforcements. Reinforcement models cannot be selected for a warcaster's warjack bond or a warlock's warbeast bond. Reinforcements lose the Ambush ability. Reinforcements with the Prey ability choose their Prey target after both players are deployed. 

        In a reinforcement scenario, during the Maintenance Phase on a player's second turn or later, reinforcement models can be placed within 3? of any point on the reinforcements line shown in the flank deployment diagram. All a player's reinforcements must be placed on the same turn.

        If a warjack controlled by a warcaster is a reinforcement model, it is allocated 3 free focus points during the focus allocation step of the Control Phase following its placement as a reinforcement. A reinforcement warjack still cannot exceed the normal focus allocation limit. If a warbeast controlled by a warlock is a reinforcement model, it can be forced while outside its controlling warlock's control area on the turn following its placement as a reinforcement.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Baseline </strong> If there is no clear winner at the end of the tournament, use the Strength of Schedule tiebreaker followed by Control Points and then Army Points Destroyed.</li>
            <li><strong>Large Event Scoring</strong> In larger events, players dropping out of the tournament adversely affect their opponents' strength of schedule. If there is no clear winner at the end of an event using large event scoring, count the tournament points scored divided by the number of games played by each opponent of the tied players. For an opponent who did not score any tournament points, use a value equal to 1 divided by the total number of rounds in the event.</li>
        </ul>
        For example, after four rounds Jason and Doug are tied for second place. To break the tie, the EO adds up the tournament points and divides by the number of games played by Jason's opponents during the previous four rounds. The EO does the same for Doug's opponents and compares the total to break the tie.

        The player whose opponents have the highest total score has the best strength of schedule score and earns the higher rank. If strength of schedule is the same for both players, go to Control Points and then Army Points as normal.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Control Point Scoring</strong> If there is no clear winner at the end of a tournament, use the Control Points tiebreaker followed by Army Points Destroyed and then Strength of Schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Assassin Scoring</strong> If there is no clear winner at the end of a tournament, use the number of 'Caster kill wins as the tiebreak condition (followed by Army Points Destroyed and then Control Points, if needed).</li>
            <li><strong>Destruction Scoring</strong> If there is no clear winner at the end of a tournament, use the total number of enemy army points destroyed or removed from play during the tournament as the tiebreak condition (followed by Control Points and then Strength of Schedule, if needed). The method below should also be used to determine awards based on army point destruction. Points are scored each time a model/unit is destroyed/removed from play; for example, if Thagrosh, Prophet of Everblight returned a Scythean to play using Dark Revival, the opponent earns 9 points for each time he destroyed the warbeast.</li>
        </ul>
        When counting destroyed army points each round use the following methods:
        <ul>
            <li>Destroyed models/units are worth their army point value.</li>
            <li>Units below 50% of their starting number (rounding up) are worth 50% of their army points (rounding up) including all attachments.</li>
            <li>Warcasters and warlocks are worth 5 army points each. Nonwarcaster/warlock models included with warcasters and warlocks have no additional value.</li>
            <li>Inert warjacks and wild warbeasts are worth their full army point values.</li>
        </ul>

        When calculating model value, use the values printed on the model/unit's card even if that model/unit was brought into the army via other means (such as Dark Industries) or if the models received a discount during army-building (such as the Call of the Wild Tier 4 Theme Force benefit). 

        <strong>Finals Tables</strong> When creating match-ups for the final round of an event, the EO pairs the current top four players on two "finals tables." The first finals table matches the current firstranked player against the current second-ranked player. The second finals table matches the current third-ranked player against the current fourth-ranked player.

        The winner of the first finals table wins the event, and his opponent wins second place. The winner of the second finals table wins third place. Standings beyond third place should be calculated using Strength of Schedule followed by Control Points in the case of a tie.

        The Finals Tables variant should be used only in events that are planned for the number of rounds recommended in the Steamroller 2014 rules based on player attendance, and it cannot be combined with any other Final Standings variant.  Also, this is not a preferred variant, as it places the luck of the draw (as to when someone lost to the champion) above gamerelated scoring metrics such as opponent difficulty, control points, army points, and assassination.

        EOs should always consider the best way to run events for their players given the resources they have available. These resources include a place to run the event, the amount of time available, templates or tokens to mark zones, timers, and so on.  For example, if you have limited time per day at the venue, you might want to consider running a larger event over two days.  Use the variants provided in this appendix to run an event that best fits the resources you have available as well as the preferred play style of your players.
