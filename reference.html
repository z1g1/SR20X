	<h1>SR 2012 Scenario Refernce Sheet</h1>
		<h2>Scenario Glossary</h2>
			<h3>Starting number</h3>
				<p>
					The number of models that a model/unit starts with based on the point cost paid. Models that are discounted always use their card’s listed point cost and model count for scoring. Models that are free also use the card’s point cost and model count for scoring. If a free model/unit does not begin the game in play, use the lowest point cost on the card to determine the model count required for scoring.
				</p>
			<h3>Own</h3>
				<p>
					Players own the models in their fielded army list and any models created by abilities of models in the army list.
				</p>
			<h3>Control</h3>
				<p>
					See Zone, Flag and Objective.
				</p>
			<h3>Contest</h3>
				<p>
					A player must own at least one model within a zone, within 4" of a flag, or within 4? of an objective to contest that zone, flag, or objective. Inert warjacks, wild warbeasts, models that are fleeing or out of formation, and models a player owns that are under the control of an opponent cannot contest.
				</p>
			<h3>Zone</h3>
				<p>
					A player controls a zone if he owns one or more models within it and no opponent contests it. Ignore inert warjacks, wild warbeasts, models that are fleeing or out of formation, and models a player owns that are under the control of an opponent when checking for control. There are no additional requirements for warcasters, warlocks,  warjacks, or warbeasts.
				</p>
				<p>
					For a unit to control a zone the unit must contain 50% or more of its starting number (rounding up) and all those remaining models must be within the same zone.
				</p>
				<p>
					For a solo to control a zone, it must have an army point cost of 1 or more. For solos that consist of multiple models, divide the point cost of the solo by the model count on the card to see if each model is worth at least 1 point. For multiple-model solos to control a zone they must contain 50% or more of their starting number (rounding up) and all those remaining models must be within the same zone.
				</p>
			<h3>Reinforcements</h3>
				<p>
					During the Maintenance Phase, on a player’s 2nd turn or later, these models can be placed within 3? of the reinforcements line shown in the scenario diagram.
				</p>
				<p>
					All a player’s reinforcements must be placed on the same turn.
				</P>
				<p>
					If a warjack controlled by a warcaster is a reinforcement model, during the focus allocation step of the Control Phase following its placement as a reinforcement it is allocated 3 free focus points. This focus cannot exceed the normal focus allocation limit. If a warbeast controlled by a warlock is a reinforcement model, on the turn
					following its placement as a reinforcement it can be forced while outside its controlling warlock’s control area.
				</p>
			<h3>Flag (40 mm base)</h3>
				<p>
					All flags are models with the following qualities:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Incorporeal, stationary models</li>
						<li>Immune to all in-game effects</li>
						<li>Do not activate</li>
						<li>Cannot be targeted, damaged, moved, placed, or removed from play</li>
					</ul>
				<p>
					A player controls a flag if he owns one or more models B2B with a flag that an opponent does not contest. When checking for control conditions ignore inert warjacks, wild warbeasts, models that are fleeing or out of formation, and models a player owns that are under the control of an opponent. There are no additional requirements for warcasters, warlocks, warjacks, or warbeasts. If the model B2B with the flag is a member of a unit, the unit must contain 50% or more of its starting number (rounding up) and all those remaining models must also be within 4? of the flag.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the model B2B with the flag is a solo it must have an army point cost of 1 or more. For solos that consist of multiple models, divide the point cost of the solo by the model count on the card to see if each model is worth at least 1 point. For multiple-model solos to control a flag the solo must contain 50% or more of its  starting number (rounding up) and all those remaining models must also be within 4? of the flag.
				</p>
			<h3>Objective (50 mm base)</h3>
				<p>
					A player controls an objective if his warcaster/warlock is within 4" of an objective that an opponent does not contest.
				</p>
				<p>
					Objectives also follow the individual rules defined on their <a href="objectives.html">objective rules cards</a>. Objectives are considered friendly models to all other models.
				</p>
			<h3>Kill Box</h3>
				<p>
					Starting on the first player’s 2nd turn, if a player ends his turn with a friendly warcaster/warlock within 10? of any board edge, that warcaster/warlock is destroyed.
				</p>
		<h2>Victory and Tiebreakers</h2>
			<h3>Assassination Victory</h3>
				<p>
					When only one player owns warcasters/warlocks remaining in play, that player immediately wins the game. Conduct control point scoring upon an assassination victory. This scoring does not change game results (that is, it cannot lead to a scenario victory) but affects the final standings. If all warcasters/warlocks are simultaneously destroyed, the game ends and victory is determined according to tiebreaker conditions.
				</p>
			<h3>Scenario Victory</h3>
				<p>
					When a player has fulfilled the victory conditions described in the scenario, that player immediately wins the game.
				</p>
			<h3>1st Tiebreaker</h3>
				<p>
					If time runs out before a player has won the game, the player who owns the most warcasters/warlocks remaining in play wins the game. If both players own the same number of warcasters/warlocks in play, check the 2nd tiebreaker to determine the winner.
				</p>
			<h3>2nd Tiebreaker</h3>
				<p>
					The player who has the most control points wins the game. If both players have the same number of control points, check the 3rd tiebreaker to determine the winner.
				</p>
			<h3>3rd Tiebreaker</h3>
				T<p>
					ally the army point value of the models/units owned by each player within the area designated by the scenario. Ignore inert warjacks, wild warbeasts, and fleeing models when checking 3rd tiebreaker conditions. The player with more army points in the designated area wins the game. If both players have the same number of army points in the designated area, check the 4th tiebreaker to determine the winner.
					<ul>
						<li>Warcasters/Warlocks: 5 points for each warcaster or warlock (regardless of warjack and warbeast bonus points) within the scoring area. If a warcaster or warlock choice consists of multiple models, all the models with the warcaster or warlock subtype must be within the scoring area. Models automatically included with the warcaster or warlock choice without the warcaster or warlock subtype do not affect warcaster/warlock scoring.</li>
						<li>Warjacks/Warbeasts: Points equal to the army point cost of the model within the scoring area.</li>
						<li>Units and Unit Attachments: Points equal to the unit’s army point cost. Ignore units that have fewer than 50% (rounding up) of their starting number remaining in play when counting army points. At least half (rounding up) of the remaining models must be within the scoring area. Models with the Attachment ability add to the unit’s value and also add to the number of models needed. For example, ten Long Gunners need five or more models in play to be worth 10 points, and twelve Long Gunners including their unit attachment need six or more models to be worth 12 points.</li>
						<li>Solos: Points equal to the army point cost of the model within the scoring area. If a solo choice consists of multiple models, when counting army points ignore solo choices that have fewer than 50% (rounding up) of their starting number remaining in play. All those remaining models must be within the scoring area for the solo choice’s value to be counted.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			<h3>4th Tiebreaker</h3>
				<p>
					Tally each player’s army points that have been destroyed or removed from play as described below. The player whose opponent suffered more army points destroyed/removed from play wins the game.
					<ul>
						<li>Models/units are worth their army points value.</li>
						<li>Units below 50% of their starting number (rounding up) are worth 50% of their army points (rounding up) including all attachments.</li>
						<li>Inert warjacks and wild warbeasts are worth their full army point value.</li>
						<li>Warcasters and warlocks are worth 5 army points each.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
		<h2>Scenario Scoring - Exceptions</h2>
			<p>
				All the standard rules for scenarios are contained within the SR2012 scenario reference sheet above. Models that do not conform well to these general guidelines are listed here with answers to the commonly asked questions as they pertain to scenarios.
			</p>
			<ul>				
				<li><strong>Model</strong>: Lesser Warlocks
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Control (Y/N)</strong>: Yes (Either model can control a zone/flag)</li>
						<li><strong>3rd Tiebreaker</strong>: All lesser warlocks are worth 2 points. Companion warbeasts included with these models are worth the Lesser Warlock’s PC minus 2.</li>
						<li><strong>4th Tiebreaker</strong>: All lesser warlocks are worth 2 points. Companion warbeasts included with these models are worth the Lesser Warlock’s PC minus 2.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Model</strong>: Light Warjacks/Warbeasts without a PC
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Control (Y/N)</strong>: Yes</li>
						<li><strong>3rd Tiebreaker</strong>: 5 Army Points</li>
						<li><strong>4th Tiebreaker</strong>: 5 Army Points</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Model</strong>: Solos without a PC
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Control (Y/N)</strong>: Yes</li>
						<li><strong>3rd Tiebreaker</strong>: 2 Army Points</li>
						<li><strong>4th Tiebreaker</strong>: 2 Army Points</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Model</strong>: Kallus’ Feat (Incubi)
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Control (Y/N), 3rd Tiebreaker, 4th Tiebraker</strong>: At the end of your opponent’s turn, group all remaining created Incubi into groups of 5 and the remainder into another group of X, which counts as X remaining from a group of 5. Each of these groups now counts as a purchased Incubi solo and follows the standard scenario rules for multiple-model solos.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Model</strong>: Feralgeist
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Control (Y/N)</strong>: Yes</li>
						<li><strong>3rd Tiebreaker</strong>: If controlling a friendly warbeast use the warbeast’s point cost. If controlling an enemy warbeast place Feralgeist in B2B contact with the controlled warbeast, using the rule of least disturbance (WARMACHINE: Prime Mk II, p.65) if necessary, then remove the warbeast from play.</li>
						<li><strong>4th Tiebreaker</strong>: 1 Army Point</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Model</strong>: Machine Wraith
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Control (Y/N)</strong>: Yes</li>
						<li><strong>3rd Tiebreaker</strong>: If controlling a friendly warjack use the warjack’s point cost. If controlling an enemy warjackplace Machine Wraith in B2B contact with the controlled warjack, using the rule of least disturbance (WARMACHINE: Prime Mk II, p.65) if necessary.</li>
						<li><strong>4th Tiebreaker</strong>: 1 Army Point</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Model</strong>: Multiple model solos that do not begin in play
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Control (Y/N)</strong>: Standard</li>
						<li><strong>3rd Tiebreaker</strong>: Standard</li>
						<li><strong>4th Tiebreaker</strong>: If a list contains two or more multiple-model solos, all casualties are counted toward the same solo until it is completely destroyed.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
